# **Introduction**

Imagine that your're a frequent traveller, and you use the public transports for travel. You would nap during the journey but waking up at the right time to get down at your desired location is not possible every time. This is where our app comes in...

- It gives the user  an  alert sound when the users get into  the notification  area  of the  device  and user  can  find  the  place through  the  use  of  the  mobile  phone  and  alert  when approaching the location. .
- This prototype creates a location based alarm service which enable  the frequent travellers  to initiate  an  alarm whenever and  wherever  it  is  needed  thus  improving  the  quality  of life.
- The  alarm  can  be  viewed,  deleted  and  edited  by  the mobile  user  without  any  contradiction  in  data  updating.
- Factors such as traffic, the route you choose etc can affect the total duration of your journey. This is why conventional time based alarms are not useful while traveling.

# **Literature Review**
There  exist  a  number  of  location  based  systems  that  can automatically  generate  alarm  by  using  mobile  phone. Examples of such systems are described in the following links 
- NapAlarm: Naplarm uses your location to alert you when you reach your destination. This is especially useful for long journeys during which you might want to take a nap.
Naplarm on the other hand uses your real-time GPS location. It is therefore rightly named Location Alarm or GPS AlarmThis means you can rest assured you will be woken only when you are near your destination.

- AlarmMe: Alarm-Me is great for daily commutes when you want to be woken when you are close to your destination. Experience a relaxing commute with confidence that you will arrive at your destination with Alarm-Me!

- Wake Me There :  With this alarm app you will never go past your destination or miss your date. This simple free GPS location alarm app for Android will also help you to keep within the mandated distance from home or any other position on the map. Easily set a perimeter.
